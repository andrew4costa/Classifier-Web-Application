# Classifier-Web-Application


The purpose of this project was to explore steamlit applications for the displayment of classifier models. 

### I used a number of different datasets to explore:
- Iris 
- Breast cancer
- Wine

### The models used were:
- KNN
- MLP
- SVM
- Random Forest

### Hyperparameter
The application also allowed for hyperparameter tunining, like adjusting the learning rate
